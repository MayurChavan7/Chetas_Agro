        <p className="mb-4">
          Chetas Agrotech Private Limited was born with a powerful idea: 
          transform waste into wealth for the soil.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Founded in Pune, Maharashtra, we respect nature and are committed 
          to sustainable farming. By processing cow dung into export-quality 
          organic fertilizer, we restore soil nutrients, boost microbial life, 
          and help farmers grow healthier crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we proudly serve organic farms and eco-conscious growers across 
          Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
